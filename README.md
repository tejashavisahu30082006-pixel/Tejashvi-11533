# Loop Optimization Demo

## Description
This project demonstrates a comparison between `for` loop and `while` loop in C.
Both loops perform the same task and count the number of iterations executed.

## Objective
- Compare `for` loop and `while` loop
- Count iterations using a counter variable
- Print results for comparison

## Tools Used
- C Language
- VS Code
- GitHub

## How to Run
- `gcc Loop_Comparison.c -o loop_demo`
- `./loop_demo`
